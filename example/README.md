# Terraform Google GKE Cluster Example

This example project gives the minimum Terraform setup required to use the [`terraform-google-gke-cluster`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/jetstack/gke-cluster/google/) module.

## Prerequisites

Check that Terraform is installed and up to date on your machine by running `terraform version`.
At the time of writing the version of binary distributed by HashiCorp is `v0.12.24`.
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html).

This guide uses the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) utility `gcloud`, which is part of the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).
Installation instructions for this can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).
The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) command line utility `gsutil` is also used to create and delete Buckets.
It is installed as part of the Cloud SDK.
Much of what these commands do can be achieved using the GCP Console, but using the commands allows this guide to be concise and precise about what to do.

Once the Cloud SDK is installed you can authenticate, set the project, and choose a compute zone with the interactive command:

```
gcloud init
```

Ensure the required APIs are enabled:

```
gcloud services enable storage-api.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
```

## Setup

**The following guide assumes commands are run from the `example` directory.**

Provide the input variables with a `terraform.tfvars` file which can be created from the example file provided:

```
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

The values set in this file should be edited according to your environment and requirements.
**You must update the `gcp_project_id` value in this file.**
Other values can be left as default, or adjusted as required.


Now create a service account for Terraform to use, generate a key file for it, and save the key location as an environment variable:

```
PROJECT_ID=[ID OF YOUR PROJECT]
gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member "serviceAccount:terraform@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role "roles/owner"
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account terraform@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$PWD/key.json"
```

**Keep the key file in a safe place, and do not share or publicise it.**

Next create a GCS Bucket that will be used to hold Terraform state information.
The Bucket name must be globally unique, the suggested name is `{PROJECT_ID}-terraform-state`.
After creating the bucket update the IAM permissions to make the `terraform` service account an `objectAdmin`.

```
REGION="europe-west1"
BUCKET_NAME="${PROJECT_ID}-terraform-state"
gsutil mb -l ${REGION} gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:terraform@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com:objectAdmin gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
```

Next, initialise Terraform with the name of the GCS Bucket just created:

```
terraform init -backend-config=bucket=${BUCKET_NAME}
```

### Applying

Now that Terraform is setup check that the configuration is valid:

```
terraform validate
```

If the configuration is valid then apply it with:

```
terraform apply
```

Inspect the output of apply to ensure that what Terraform is going to do what you want, if so then enter `yes` at the prompt.
The infrastructure will then be created, this make take a some time.

### Clean Up

Remove the infrastructure created by Terraform with:

```
terraform destroy
```

Sometimes Terraform may report a failure to destroy some resources due to dependencies and timing contention.
In this case wait a few seconds and run the above command again.
If it is still unable to remove everything it may be necessary to remove resources manually using the `gcloud` command or the Cloud Console.

The GCS Bucket used for Terraform state storage can be removed with:

```
gsutil rm -r gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
```
